# Image Prediction AI/ML Project with ImageAI

## Introduction

Welcome to the Image Prediction AI/ML project using ImageAI! In this project, we'll explore the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) by building a simple image prediction model.

Have you ever wondered how computers can "see" and identify objects in images? This project will take you on a journey into the realms of AI and ML, unraveling their basic concepts and showing you how to create your own image prediction model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Python**: Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- **ImageAI Library**: Install it using `pip install imageai`.
- **Images**: Gather the images you want to perform predictions on.

### Objectives

By the end of this project, you will:

- Understand the basics of AI and ML.
- Use ImageAI's pre-trained models for image prediction.
- Interpret predictions and probabilities generated by the model.

## Usage

Follow these simple steps to create your image prediction model:

#### Step 1: Import necessary libraries and set the execution path

from imageai.Classification import ImageClassification
import os

execution_path = os.getcwd()

#### Step 2: Choose your desired algorithm and load the model

Choose one of the available algorithms and load the corresponding model:

from imageai.Classification import ImageClassification
import os

execution_path = os.getcwd()

prediction = ImageClassification()
prediction.setModelTypeAsDenseNet121()  # Choose your algorithm here
prediction.setModelPath(os.path.join(execution_path, "model_file.pth"))  # Path to the model file
prediction.loadModel()

#### Step 3: Perform image prediction

Replace "house.jpg" with the path to the image you want to predict, and run the prediction code:

from imageai.Classification import ImageClassification
import os

execution_path = os.getcwd()

prediction = ImageClassification()
prediction.setModelTypeAsDenseNet121()  # Choose your algorithm here
prediction.setModelPath(os.path.join(execution_path, "model_file.pth"))  # Path to the model file
prediction.loadModel()

predictions, probabilities = prediction.classifyImage(os.path.join(execution_path, "house.jpg"), result_count=5)

for eachPrediction, eachProbability in zip(predictions, probabilities):
    print(eachPrediction, " : ", eachProbability)
